# Starter
Starter with sass (not JS yet)

You need to have sass install and just "npm run sass" in terminal! (So node JS install to)
For some reason that's no working properly with "watch sass" btn on the bottom of VS code (if u use it) even with the last version of the extension

package.json really simple and basic for now but is working well with what i want to do!

You can .gitignore node_modules/ if u push your work on github.
